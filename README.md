Explain medical note to people with out any such background using state-of-art summarization techniques


Doctors write notes in language and writing that is hard to understand. The ineligible writing can be mitigated by preparing elec- tronic records or computer vision algorithms that converts it to a more readable format. One other problems remains, how do ordinary peo- ple understand the medical note, even after be- ing able to read it. The main motivation behind this project is to make a note more readable. I use wikipedia API to infuse more information into the medical note and then summarizing this expanded note using state-of-the-art pre- trained models using both Abstractive and ex- tractive techniques. The results however were not satisfactory, I found a decrease in reading scores by 8.3, although my initial hypothesis was that the such a technique would increase ease of reading.
